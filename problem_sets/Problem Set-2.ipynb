    "Consider a portfolio consisting of two assets with random returns $R_1$ and $R_2$. The portfolio weights are $w$ and $(1-w)$, where $0 \\leq w \\leq 1$. Let $U(R) = -e^{-\\gamma R}$ be a utility function, where $\\gamma > 0$ is the risk aversion coefficient and $R$ is the portfolio return. Using Jensen's Inequality, determine whether the expected utility of the portfolio is greater than or less than the utility of the expected portfolio return. Explain your reasoning and the financial implication."
