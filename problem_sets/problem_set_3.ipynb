    "A portfolio manager is responsible for designing a portfolio insurance strategy to mitigate downside risk over the next six months. The manager oversees a $750,000$ portfolio, which consists of high-beta stocks with a portfolio beta of $1.5$ relative to the market index. The index currently stands at $S_0 = 1200$, and the risk-free rate is $10\\%$ per annum. The index pays a continuous dividend yield of $3\\%$ per annum.\n",
    "The manager intends to use European put options on the index for hedging, where each contract covers $100$ index units.\n",

    "1.  The manager wants to ensure the portfolio does not fall below $650,000$ at expiration. Compute the hedge ratio based on portfolio beta and determine the exact number of put contracts required to achieve this insurance.\n",
    "2. Express the protection level in terms of the index value and derive the strike price $K$ of the put options needed to provide the required insurance.\n",
    "3. Assume that in six months, the index falls to $S_T = 1050$. Compute the unhedged portfolio value based on its beta-adjusted return. Determine the payoff from the put options and the total value of the hedged portfolio. Does the strategy ensure that the portfolio remains above $650,000$?\n",
    "4. Suppose the portfolio beta increases to $2.2$ due to increased exposure to volatile stocks. Derive the adjusted hedge ratio and compute the number of put contracts required to maintain the same level of protection.\n",
    "    * Compute the new index level corresponding to a protected portfolio value of $650,000$ and determine the required strike price.\n",
    "5. Derive a general formula for the cost of portfolio insurance as a function of beta, portfolio value, and option price.\n",
    "    *   Explain why higher beta leads to increased hedging costs, considering both:\n",
    "        *   The number of put contracts required.\n",
    "        *   The pricing impact on put options due to higher portfolio volatility.\n",
